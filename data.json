Also, make sure to work in a well ventilated area and do not allow fuel vapors to gather. This is a repair best suited for outdoor, on solid level ground.

Using new hose clamps, install fuel lines (starting with the inlet). Tighten hose clamps being careful not to over-torque. Once all fuel lines are connected and tight, reinstall the fuel pump fuse and start the engine. Let the engine run for about 1 minute. Then recheck your work and confirm there are no fuel leaks.
